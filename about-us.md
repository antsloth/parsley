<font size="3em">Today&#8217;s debt collection industry is rife with companies that do not adhere to the rules and regulations promulgated by the <strong>Fair Debt Collection Practices Act</strong>, which is enforced by the <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong>. Our company relies on these regulations to quickly and professionally engender an amicable solution for all parties involved. As such, we do not condone abusive or obscene language, harassment, or impersonation of attorneys or law enforcement. We do not make phone calls before 8:00 A.M. in the morning or after 9:00 P.M at night. We are committed to the highest standards of compliance, as our well-trained staff handles all delinquent accounts in a courteous, pleasant, and professional manner. </p> 

<p>
  From start to finish, it is our duty to provide a positive, helpful experience to all of our clients. Our services offer individuals striving to improve their credit scores a convenient, straightforward, and affordable way to manage their accounts receivable and past-due. Upon completion of a payment arrangement to settle a debt, we will update the status of the account as paid and send you the appropriate paperwork immediately. We look forward to the prospect of helping you as needed in any way possible.</font>
